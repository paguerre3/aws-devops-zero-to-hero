**The AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that allows you to interact with AWS services directly from your command line**. It enables users to manage AWS resources, automate tasks, and execute commands without needing to use the AWS Management Console.

Key features of AWS CLI:
- **Interacts with all AWS services**: You can manage services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and more from the terminal.
- **⚠️ Automation: Automate repetitive tasks through scripts and batch processes.**
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Credentials**: Uses IAM roles or access keys for authentication.

Example command:
```bash
aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://mybucket/
```
This uploads a file to an S3 bucket.
