# AWS Cloud Migration

**AWS Cloud Migration involves moving your workloads, applications, and data from on-premises environments, other cloud providers, or legacy systems to AWS.** Successful migration to the cloud typically requires a strategic approach, known as the **6 R's of Cloud Migration**, and a set of specialized AWS migration tools that help streamline the process.

### **AWS Cloud Migration Strategies: The 6 R’s**

These six strategies, commonly known as the "6 R’s of Cloud Migration," help guide organizations in deciding the best way to move their applications to AWS:

1. **Rehost ("Lift and Shift")**:
   - **Definition: Moving applications from an on-premises or other cloud environment to AWS without making any significant changes.**
   - **Use Case:** Suitable for organizations looking for a fast migration with minimal changes to their applications.
   - **Tools:** AWS **Application Migration Service** (AWS MGN) automates the lift-and-shift process.
   - **Example:** Migrating virtual machines from on-premises to Amazon EC2.

2. **Replatform ("Lift, Tinker, and Shift")**:
   - **Definition: Making a few optimizations to the applications without changing their core architecture before migrating.**
   - **Use Case:** When slight modifications can improve performance or reduce cost but the core functionality remains the same.
   - **Tools:** AWS **Elastic Beanstalk** and **RDS** to replatform databases and applications.
   - **Example: Moving a database to Amazon RDS without changing the application logic.**

3. **Repurchase ("Drop and Shop")**:
   - **Definition: Moving from a legacy system to a newer, cloud-native solution, often via a SaaS-based offering.**
   - **Use Case:** When it's more cost-effective to switch to a new system rather than migrating and optimizing the old one.
   - **Tools:** AWS **Marketplace** for purchasing cloud-native software solutions.
   - **Example:** Moving from a self-managed CRM to Salesforce or a similar SaaS platform.

4. **Refactor/Rearchitect**:
   - **Definition: Rebuilding the application architecture to take full advantage of AWS-native features, improving scalability, performance, or maintainability.**
   - **Use Case:** Ideal for complex applications that need modernization to fit a cloud-native architecture.
   - **Tools:** AWS **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, **Fargate**, and **API Gateway** for serverless architectures.
   - **Example:** Breaking a monolithic application into microservices deployed on containers or Lambda functions.

5. **Retire**:
   - **Definition: Identifying and decommissioning outdated or redundant applications that are no longer needed.**
   - **Use Case:** For applications that have outlived their usefulness, eliminating them can reduce costs.
   - **Tools:** AWS **Trusted Advisor** and **Cost Explorer** to identify underutilized resources.
   - **Example:** Shutting down legacy applications no longer in use.

6. **Retain**:
   - **Definition: Keeping certain applications on-premises or in their current environment while migrating other workloads to the cloud.**
   - **Use Case:** When some applications need to remain on-premises due to compliance, latency, or other business reasons.
   - **Tools:** **AWS Outposts** to run AWS infrastructure on-premises.
   - **Example:** Keeping latency-sensitive applications on-prem while moving other parts to AWS.

### **AWS Migration Tools**

AWS offers a wide range of services and tools that facilitate different stages of the migration process, including assessment, migration, modernization, and optimization. Here are some of the key AWS migration tools:

#### **1. AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN)**
   - **Purpose:** Enables "Lift and Shift" migrations by automating the replication of on-premises servers to AWS without any changes to the application.
   - **Use Case:** Migrate applications to EC2 without refactoring or rewriting.
   - **Features:**
     - Continuous data replication.
     - Simplifies testing and cutover.
   - **Example:** Migrating virtual machines or physical servers to Amazon EC2.

#### **2. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)**
   - **Purpose:** Facilitates the migration of databases to AWS with minimal downtime.
   - **Use Case:** Supports homogeneous (e.g., Oracle to Oracle) and heterogeneous migrations (e.g., SQL Server to Amazon Aurora).
   - **Features:**
     - Supports continuous data replication during migration.
     - Schema conversion for heterogeneous migrations.
   - **Example:** Migrating from on-premises MySQL to Amazon Aurora.

#### **3. AWS Server Migration Service (AWS SMS)**
   - **Purpose:** Simplifies and automates the migration of on-premises workloads to AWS.
   - **Use Case:** Incremental replication of live server volumes to AWS.
   - **Features:**
     - Provides an easy way to replicate live workloads for migration.
     - Supports Windows and Linux VMs.
   - **Example:** Moving VMs from VMware or Hyper-V to AWS EC2.

#### **4. AWS Migration Hub**
   - **Purpose:** Centralized tool to track the progress of application migrations across multiple AWS and third-party migration tools.
   - **Use Case:** Provides a unified view of all your migration projects, including those using AWS DMS or AWS SMS.
   - **Features:**
     - Centralized progress tracking.
     - Integration with various AWS migration services.
   - **Example:** Tracking multiple migration efforts within a large enterprise.

#### **5. AWS Snow Family (Snowcone, Snowball, Snowmobile)**
   - **Purpose:** Enables physical data migration via hardware appliances for large-scale or sensitive data transfers where network-based migration is impractical.
   - **Use Case:** When bandwidth constraints or high data volumes make it impractical to transfer data over the network.
   - **Features:**
     - Snowcone: Lightweight device for small data migrations.
     - Snowball: Device for petabyte-scale data transfers.
     - Snowmobile: Shipping container-sized service for transferring exabytes of data.
   - **Example:** Migrating large data archives from on-premises to Amazon S3.

#### **6. AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT)**
   - **Purpose:** Converts database schemas from one database engine to another during heterogeneous migrations.
   - **Use Case:** Useful when migrating from proprietary databases like Oracle or SQL Server to AWS-native databases like Amazon Aurora or DynamoDB.
   - **Features:**
     - Supports automated schema conversions.
     - Identifies and flags manual conversions required.
   - **Example:** Migrating an Oracle database to Amazon Aurora.

#### **7. AWS CloudEndure**
   - **Purpose:** Provides disaster recovery and cloud migration services, allowing for minimal downtime.
   - **Use Case:** Often used for business continuity and disaster recovery purposes, but can also be used for lift-and-shift migrations.
   - **Features:**
     - Continuous block-level replication.
     - Fast cutover with near-zero downtime.
