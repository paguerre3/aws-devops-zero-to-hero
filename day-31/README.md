### **Key Features of AWS Pricing Calculator**

1. **Service Selection**:
   - You can choose from a wide range of AWS services like EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, and many others. The tool provides the flexibility to configure each service based on your specific requirements (e.g., instance type, region, storage size).

2. **Cost Estimates**:
   - The calculator gives detailed estimates for different AWS services, breaking down costs into compute, storage, data transfer, and other components. It provides both **monthly costs** and **annual costs**, giving you a clear view of your potential expenses.

3. **Savings Plans & Reserved Instances**:
   - AWS Pricing Calculator allows you to see the savings from **Savings Plans** and **Reserved Instances**, helping you compare the cost of on-demand services against these more cost-efficient options.

4. **Customizable Inputs**:
   - The tool is highly customizable, allowing users to input specific data related to their usage:
     - Compute resources (e.g., number of instances, usage hours per day).
     - Storage (e.g., data stored, retrievals).
     - Network traffic (e.g., data transfer in and out).

5. **Export and Share Estimates**:
   - You can export your cost estimates to **CSV** or share them directly with your team. This makes it easy to collaborate and review your cost model with stakeholders.

6. **Comparisons**:
   - The calculator lets you compare different configurations side by side, helping you choose the best cost-effective solution for your requirements.

7. **Cost Summary**:
   - A detailed **summary page** at the end of the estimate provides the overall cost breakdown, including all services, storage, transfer fees, etc.

8. **Support for Complex Architectures**:
   - The tool can model estimates for complex, multi-service architectures like microservices, distributed systems, or entire application stacks, allowing you to estimate the costs of interconnected services.
