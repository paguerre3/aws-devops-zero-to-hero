# Aurora

**Amazon Aurora Serverless is a feature of Amazon Aurora (a fully managed relational database engine compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL) that provides on-demand, auto-scaling capabilities without needing to manage database instances.** It automatically starts up, shuts down, and scales capacity up or down based on the application’s needs.

### **Aurora Serverless v2**
Amazon has introduced **Aurora Serverless v2**, which improves upon the original version with additional features for scalability and cost-efficiency.

---

### **Key Features of Aurora Serverless**

1. **Auto-Scaling**:
   - Aurora Serverless automatically adjusts its database capacity in fine-grained increments (Aurora Capacity Units, or ACUs) based on your application’s workload. This ensures you only pay for the capacity you actually use, making it a cost-effective solution for workloads with unpredictable or variable demand.

2. **On-Demand**:
   - Aurora Serverless can instantly scale up or down without manual intervention. It is ideal for applications that experience irregular traffic patterns, such as development environments, infrequently used applications, or seasonal workloads.

3. **No Idle Costs**:
   - When there is no activity, Aurora Serverless automatically pauses the database (if configured), eliminating unnecessary compute costs while keeping the storage active. It resumes when requests are made to the database.

4. **Pay-Per-Use Pricing**:
   - You only pay for the database capacity and storage that your application uses. Costs are based on the amount of ACUs consumed per second, plus the storage and I/O operations required.

5. **Compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL**:
   - Aurora Serverless supports both the MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible versions of Amazon Aurora, making it easy to migrate existing workloads to a serverless model.

6. **Fault-Tolerant and Highly Available**:
   - Aurora Serverless stores your data across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), ensuring high availability and durability even in case of failure.

7. **Rapid Scaling with Aurora Serverless v2**:
   - Aurora Serverless v2 offers more flexible scaling options, capable of scaling to hundreds of thousands of ACUs in fine-grained increments, allowing your database to handle spikes in traffic seamlessly. It can also be provisioned to scale near-instantaneously for production workloads.
